# Superstore_data_VIZ
A business analysis is done on superstore dataset and using machine learning, suggestions are made.

Softwares used:
* Tableau public
* Microsoft excel
* Microsoft Powerpoint

Packages used for machine learning model
* Scikit learn
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

1) The **SampleSuperstore-beginner.xlsx** dataset is first analyzed and using Tableau the analysis is further done through visualization.  
**It was found that, higher discounts are leading to higher losses. So, to undertsand the change in profits if discount is reduced, a random forest machine learning model is used.**

2) For using the ML model, the data is tweaked and changed into **SampleSuperstor-ML.csv**.  
**From the ML model, an accuracy of more than 99% is obtained.**

3) Then, for the trained model, another tweaked dataset **SampleSuperstore-ML-Forecast.csv** is presented and the prediction is made as **SampleSuperstore - beginner - Forecast.xlsx**.  
**From the prediction, we got the data with profits for 0 discount rate and this forecast was used to make suggestions for the business plans.**

Complete data viz is given in ppt and pdf formats.
The ML code is written in python and executed in Jupyter notebook.
